## Here's an example Laravel migration file that creates a table with all 50 columns listed in the previous:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class CreateExampleTable extends Migration
{
    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('example', function (Blueprint $table) {
            // Primary key - auto-incrementing integer
            $table->bigIncrements('id');

            // Basic columns
            $table->string('name');
            $table->string('email')->unique();
            $table->string('password');

            // Integer columns
            $table->integer('age');
            $table->integer('number_of_children');
            $table->integer('direct_report_count');
            $table->integer('vacation_days');
            $table->integer('sick_days');

            // Decimal columns
            $table->decimal('income', 8, 2);

            $table->decimal('bonus', 8, 2);
            $table->decimal('commission', 8, 2);
            $table->decimal('tax_rate', 5, 2);
            $table->decimal('deductions', 8, 2);
            $table->decimal('performance_rating', 3, 1);

            // String columns
            $table->string('gender', 10);
            $table->string('phone_number', 20);
            $table->string('address', 100);
            $table->string('city', 50);
            $table->string('state', 50);
            $table->string('zip_code', 25);
            $table->string('country', 50);
            $table->string('occupation', 50);
            $table->string('employer', 100)->nullable();
            $table->string('job_title', 50)->nullable();
            $table->string('company_address', 100)->nullable();
            $table->string('emergency_contact_name', 50);
            $table->string('emergency_contact_relationship', 50);
            $table->string('emergency_contact_phone', 20);
            $table->string('health_conditions', 100);
            $table->string('medications', 100);
            $table->string('allergies', 100);
            $table->string('blood_type', 10);
            $table->string('marital_status', 20);
            $table->string('spouse_name', 50)->nullable();
            $table->string('child_names', 100)->nullable();
            $table->string('employee_id', 20)->unique();
            $table->string('supervisor_id', 20)->nullable();
            $table->string('department', 50);
            $table->string('referral_source', 100);

            // Date columns
            $table->date('start_date');
            $table->date('end_date')->nullable();
            $table->date('hire_date');
            $table->date('termination_date')->nullable();

            // Insurance provider columns
            $table->string('health_insurance_provider', 100)->nullable();
            $table->string('dental_insurance_provider', 100)->nullable();
            $table->string('vision_insurance_provider', 100)->nullable();
            $table->string('life_insurance_provider', 100)->nullable();
            $table->string('disability_insurance_provider', 100)->nullable();

            // Other metadata columns
            $table->timestamps(); // created_at and updated_at timestamp columns
        });
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('example');
    }
}
```

The migration encompasses comprehensive instructions for every column, outlining the data type it can hold, the highest limit or accuracy of its values, and its mandatory status. It also incorporates suitable accuracy and limit values for string and decimal columns to economize on database storage.

You can run this migration using the `php artisan migrate` command in your Laravel project's terminal.
